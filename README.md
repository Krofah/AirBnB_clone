AirBnB clone - The console
The AirBnB_cloneis a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface
A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

Description of the command interpreter:
Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
